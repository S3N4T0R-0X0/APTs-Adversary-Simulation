# Ricochet Chollima APT Adversary Simulation

This is a simulation of an attack by the (Ricochet Chollima) APT group, targeting several activists focused on North Korea. The attack campaign began in March 2025. The attack chain started with spear-phishing. The email contained a Dropbox link leading to a compressed archive that included a malicious shortcut (LNK) file. When extracted and executed, the LNK file activated additional malware containing the keyword "toy." The content was disguised as an academic forum invitation from a South Korean national security think tank to attract attention.

This simulation is based on research from Genians: https://www.genians.co.kr/en/blog/threat_intelligence/toybox-story
